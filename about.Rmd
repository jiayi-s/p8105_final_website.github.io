### About this site

Sometimes you need to say a bit about the site -- how it was made, where it's hosted, where the source code can be found. 

If this is for a project or analysis, I recommend giving some details about the R package versions that you used to create the content.

```{r}

```


```{r echo=FALSE}
icon::fa("hourglass-start", size = 3)
```
